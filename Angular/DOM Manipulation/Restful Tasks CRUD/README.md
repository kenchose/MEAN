#Objective
Have an Angular app make an http request to an API when the user clicks a button
Alter the DOM based on user interaction without refreshing the page
Add a button so the user may trigger the fetch to get all tasks
Display the fetched tasks in the html
Provide a button for each task to display its details

##Development server
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

##Code scaffolding
Run ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.

##Build
Run ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.
